# 🔧 FIX: Extension Detection Issue

## ✅ Extension is Loaded, But Not Detected on file:// URLs

The extension is properly loaded in Chrome (as shown in your screenshot), but the test page shows "Extension not loaded" because **Chrome extensions have limited access to `file://` URLs for security reasons**.

## 🎯 Solution: Use Localhost Instead of file:// URLs

### Step 1: Start the Test Server
Run this command in the extension folder:
```bash
node start-test-server.js
```

### Step 2: Access Test Pages via Localhost
Instead of opening `file://` URLs, use these localhost URLs:
- **Main Test**: http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
- **Simple Test**: http://localhost:8000/test-simple-extension.html
- **Debug Test**: http://localhost:8000/debug-extension.html
- **Gmail API Test**: http://localhost:8000/gmail-api-test.html

### Step 3: Test the Extension
1. Open http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html in Chrome
2. You should now see "✅ Extension is loaded!"
3. Content script injection should work properly

## 🔍 Why This Happens

### Chrome Extension Security Restrictions:
- ❌ `file://` URLs have limited extension access
- ❌ Content scripts may not inject properly
- ❌ `chrome.runtime` may not be available
- ✅ `localhost` URLs work normally
- ✅ `https://` URLs work normally

### Your Current Situation:
- ✅ Extension is loaded in Chrome
- ✅ Extension toggle is ON
- ✅ No errors in chrome://extensions/
- ❌ Test pages use `file://` protocol
- ❌ Chrome blocks extension access to `file://` URLs

## 🚀 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Localhost Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the test server
node start-test-server.js

# Then open http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
```

### Option 2: Use Python Server
```bash
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
```

### Option 3: Use npx serve
```bash
# Install and run serve
npx serve . -p 8000

# Then open http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
```

## 🎯 Expected Results with Localhost

After using localhost URLs:
- ✅ "Extension is loaded!" should appear
- ✅ "Content script is injected!" should appear
- ✅ `chrome.runtime` should be available
- ✅ `window.billableAI` object should exist
- ✅ All API functions should work

## 📋 Quick Test

1. **Start server**: `node start-test-server.js`
2. **Open**: http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
3. **Check**: Should show ✅ instead of ❌
4. **Test**: All functions should work

## 🚨 Important Notes

- **Don't use `file://` URLs** for testing extensions
- **Always use `localhost` or `https://`** for extension testing
- **The extension is working correctly** - it's just a URL protocol issue
- **This is normal Chrome behavior** for security reasons

**The extension is perfectly fine! Just use localhost URLs instead of file:// URLs for testing.** 🎉
