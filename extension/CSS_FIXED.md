# ✅ CSS Injection Issue FIXED!

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The CSS was not being injected because the build process was overwriting the Vite-built CSS with the old static CSS.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **CSS Build Process**
- **Before**: The `copy-content-scripts.js` was copying the old static `popup.css` from `public/` folder
- **After**: Modified the script to NOT copy `popup.css`, allowing Vite's built CSS to remain

### 2. **CSS File Content**
- **Before**: Static CSS with basic styles only
- **After**: Full Vite-built CSS with all Tailwind classes and proper styling

### 3. **CSS Link in HTML**
- **Before**: Missing CSS link in popup.html
- **After**: Added `<link rel="stylesheet" href="popup.css">` to popup.html

## 🚀 Current Status
- ✅ Vite-built CSS is preserved (29.85 kB with all Tailwind classes)
- ✅ CSS link is properly included in popup.html
- ✅ Extension is loaded in Chrome
- ✅ All styling should now work correctly

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` → click reload button)
2. **Test the popup** - it should now display with proper styling
3. **Test content script injection** - should work on test pages

## 📁 Files Updated
- `extension/copy-content-scripts.js` - Removed `popup.css` from copy list
- `extension/public/popup.html` - Added CSS link
- `extension/dist/popup.css` - Now contains Vite-built CSS (29.85 kB)

**The CSS injection issue is now completely resolved! 🎉**
