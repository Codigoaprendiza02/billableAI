# 🔧 RELOAD EXTENSION AND TEST

## ✅ Manifest Fixed - Content Script Injection Issue Resolved

The manifest.json has been updated to properly inject content scripts into localhost URLs.

## 🚀 Steps to Test the Fixed Extension

### Step 1: Reload the Extension in Chrome
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find the "BillableAI" extension
3. Click the reload button (🔄) next to the extension
4. This will reload the updated manifest.json with correct localhost patterns

### Step 2: Start the Test Server
```bash
node start-test-server.js
```

### Step 3: Test the Extension
Open these URLs in Chrome:
- **Main Test**: http://localhost:8000/test-local-server.html
- **Simple Test**: http://localhost:8000/test-simple-extension.html
- **Debug Test**: http://localhost:8000/debug-extension.html

## 🎯 Expected Results

After reloading the extension, you should see:
- ✅ "Extension is loaded!" instead of "❌ Extension not loaded"
- ✅ "Content script is injected!" instead of "❌ Content script not injected"
- ✅ `chrome.runtime` should be available
- ✅ `window.billableAI` object should exist

## 🔍 What Was Fixed

### Before (Not Working):
```json
"matches": ["*://localhost/*", "file://*"]
```

### After (Fixed):
```json
"matches": ["http://localhost:*/*", "http://127.0.0.1:*/*", "file://*"]
```
