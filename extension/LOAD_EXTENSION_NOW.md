# URGENT: Load the Extension in Chrome

## ❌ Problem: Extension Not Loaded
The error "❌ chrome.runtime not available" means the extension is NOT installed in Chrome.

## ✅ Solution: Load the Extension

### Step 1: Open Chrome Extensions Page
1. Open Chrome browser
2. Type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
3. Press Enter

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode
1. Look for the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner
2. Turn it ON (toggle should be blue)

### Step 3: Load the Extension
1. Click the "Load unpacked" button (blue button)
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\riyan\OneDrive\Desktop\BillableAI\extension\dist`
3. **Select the `dist` folder** (not the parent folder)
4. Click "Select Folder"

### Step 4: Verify Extension is Loaded
1. You should see "BillableAI" appear in the extensions list
2. Make sure the toggle next to it is ON (enabled)
3. There should be no red error messages

### Step 5: Test Immediately
1. Open `extension/test-extension-loaded.html` in Chrome
2. You should now see "✅ Extension is loaded!" instead of "❌ chrome.runtime not available"

## Why This Happened:
- The extension files are built correctly in the `dist` folder
- But Chrome doesn't automatically load extensions - you must manually load them
- The "Load unpacked" feature is how you install development extensions

## Expected Results After Loading:
- ✅ `chrome.runtime` will be available
- ✅ `window.billableAI` object will be injected into pages
- ✅ Content scripts will work on `file://` URLs
- ✅ All test pages will work properly
